You control your ship with either WASD or the arrow keys, depending on your handedness.

Left rotates left, right rotates right. Forward fires thrusters, back slows down thrust. CTRL fires.

1, 2 and 3 set the range of the radar: short (C), medium (M) and long (L)

Look for the blue dot. It's where the next symbol is, or its direction. It is possible for there to be more than one blue dot, but rarely occurs.

Once you destroy the rock or alien ship that holds the symbol, it should appear. You can then fly into it to collect it.

This was created with Godot v3.2.1.stable

The infinite starfield is a parallax layer controlling a sprite thats greater than the size of the window. Originally I had a sprite with a large region, but that runs out eventually.
