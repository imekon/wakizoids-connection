You control your ship with either WASD or the arrow keys, depending on your handedness.

Left rotates left, right rotates right. Forward fires thrusters, back slows down thrust. CTRL fires.

1, 2 and 3 set the range of the radar: short (C), medium (M) and long (L)

The radar will show the next symbol to find as a blue dot - it's hiding as a rock or an alien ship. You need to destroy it to release the symbol. Once released the radar shows it as a larger blue dot.

If you see \"Symbol Lost\" on the radar, then all hope is lost. The next symbol is missing or destroyed. You can't win.

Once you destroy the rock or alien ship that holds the symbol, it should appear. You can then fly into it to collect it.

This was created with Godot v3.2.1.stable

The infinite starfield is a parallax layer controlling a sprite thats greater than the size of the window. Originally I had a sprite with a large region, but that runs out eventually.
